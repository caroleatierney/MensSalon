Maggies Website without responsive coding
This is my first website designed with my hairdresser.
It works for computer size screens but needs to be coded to be responsive to tablets and phones.

## I met with my hairdresser to design a website for her business.

Using the internet for resources I developed a simple website using CSS, HTML and PHP.

There is a google map link, an email link, social icon links and most importantly a link to appointment software.

The website is not in use because my hairdresser had to use the software that she uses for billing to get her free website domain.

I self taught myself how to build this website initially and modified it a little after boot camp.
